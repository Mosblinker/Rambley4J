# Rambley4J
 "Hi, I'm Rambley. Rambley the Java Raccoon. And it's my job to make sure your experience here at Indigo Park is the most rendered it can be!"

 A program that renders Rambley the raccon from Indigo Park. A bit of an experiment to see if I can draw more complex images such as cartoon characters using only math and Java graphics commands.

 This program requires my custom SwingExtended library and my custom FilesExtended library.
