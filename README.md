# Rambley4J
 "Hi, I'm Rambley. Rambley the Java Raccoon. And it's my job to make sure your experience here at Indigo Park is the most rendered it can be!"

 A program that renders Rambley the raccon from Indigo Park. A bit of an experiment to see if I can draw more complex images such as cartoon characters using only math and Java graphics commands.

 This program requires my custom SwingExtended library, my custom FilesExtended library, and my GeomArt4J library, at least for the time being. This is mainly for the test program.

 Special thanks to AnimalWave on Discord for providing some of the equations.
