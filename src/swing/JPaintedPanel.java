     * in the form of a {@code Graphics2D} object, is passed to the {@code

     * Graphics2D} object, then the {@code paintComponent2D} will paint to an 
     * image which is then painted by the {@code Graphics} object. <p>

     * If you override this in a subclass you should not make any permanent 
     * changes to the given {@code Graphics} object. You may find it easier to 
     * create and use a copy of the given {@code Graphics} object. Further, if 
     * you do not invoke super's implementation you must honor the opaque 
     * property (i.e. if this component is opaque then you must completely fill 
     * in the background with an opaque color), least risk the appearance of 
     * visual artifacts. <p>
